**Projects**
- *Movie Recommendation System With Python And Pandas: Data Project*
  - This project involves creating a movie recommendation system using Python and Pandas. It focuses on collecting and analyzing movie data to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

- *Airflow Data Pipeline for Podcast Downloads*
  - In addition to the core projects, students will have the opportunity to work on a real-world data engineering project inspired by "Build an Airflow Data Pipeline to Download Podcasts." This project involves building a four-step data pipeline using Apache Airflow, a popular Python-based data engineering tool. The pipeline will download podcast episodes and store them in an easily queryable SQLite database. Through this project, students will gain practical experience in building data pipelines, scheduling tasks, handling errors, and parallelizing tasks using Airflow. They will also have the chance to extend the project by adding features like speech recognition and summaries, further enhancing their skills in data engineering.

**Important Practices to Follow**
- **Code Refactoring**: Refactoring is not just a one-time activity but an ongoing process. Well-refactored code is easier to understand, debug, and maintain. We strongly encourage you to refactor your code as you progress with your projects.
- **Clean Code Principles**: Writing clean code is essential for the long-term maintainability of your projects. Follow principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple) to make your code more effective and easier to understand.
- **Linting**: A linting score of at least 9/10 is required for this assignment. Utilize tools like pylint to analyze your code and adhere to best practices.
- **Exception Handling**: Proper exception handling can make your code robust and easier to debug. Use Python’s try, except, and finally blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
- **Logging**: Include logging in your projects to capture runtime information, which can be invaluable for debugging and monitoring your code's behavior. Use Python’s built-in logging library to include logs at various levels such as INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR.
- **Unit Testing**: The inclusion of unit tests is mandatory. Tests validate that your code works as expected and make it easier for future you or other developers to change the code with confidence.
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Leverage GitHub Codespaces for prototyping and initial development. Codespaces provide a complete, configurable dev environment that allows you to code directly within GitHub.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Implement a Command Line Interface to allow users to interact with your project easily. This is crucial as it offers a versatile way of running different functionalities and options in your code.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Airflow 2.3+
- Pandas: `pip install pandas`
- sqlite3: follow these instructions
- xmltodict: `pip install xmltodict`
- requests: `pip install requests`

*Note: You will run the code on your local machine, so you need to set up your computer properly and install the necessary packages.*

This course offers valuable insights into machine learning-based systems design and equips students with essential skills for building, maintaining, and deploying machine learning models in real-world scenarios. By the end of this course, students will have the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to excel in the field of machine learning-based systems design.
