# Build an Airflow Data Pipeline to Download Podcasts
This project aims to provide automated tools for handling and analyzing podcast episodes. Using modern technologies and advanced libraries, we seek to simplify the workflow for podcast producers and enthusiasts.

## Overview

The platform offers a range of functionalities, from searching and storing podcast episodes to their transcription and analysis. Automation is key to ensuring that the latest content is always processed and available for analysis.

## Features

- **Automatic Episode Fetching**: Our solution regularly checks podcast sources to identify and download new episodes.
- **Audio Transcription**: Automatically convert the audio content of episodes into text to facilitate analysis and accessibility.
- **Content Analysis**: Delve into the transcribed content to gain insights on the topics covered in the episodes.

## Installation Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Apache Airflow: For task automation and orchestration.
- SQLite: Used for episode data storage.
- Other Python libraries: `requests`, `xmltodict`, `vosk`, `pydub`.

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    cd your_repository
    ```

2. **Virtual Environment**:
   It's recommended to create a virtual environment for installing the project's dependencies:
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

1. **Configuration**: Set up the environment ensuring all dependencies are installed and services (like Apache Airflow) are running.
2. **Customization**: Adapt the code as necessary to cater to your specific needs, such as pointing to different podcast sources or adjusting transcription parameters.
3. **Execution**: Start the scripts or DAGs and monitor the process through the provided interfaces (like Apache Airflow's web interface).
